# Chat with Bot for Microsoft

Here are some small projects that implement very easy chat with bot
Because of requirements (No Backend, in-memory storage only, 4 hours for test task) it completely doesn't look like real chat, when you communicate with server

There are two implementations of this test task:
- only React, when I use only React View and Main Component to handle logic of childs
- resub (because reactXP connected with it)
